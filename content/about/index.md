## About Me
**_Sam Lee_** is an undergraduate researcher at Brigham Young University studying Statistics and Economics with special interests in Bayesian methods, Econometrics, Environmental Economics, and topics in social science including Education and Psychology.

He has worked prolifically on large scale web-scraping projects, specifically with scraping data on dynamically integrated websites. He has strong experience in statistical modeling, including multivariate linear regression and random forest machine learning and natural language processing.   

Sam is a strong advocate for mental health and supporting those who suffer from chronic illnesses, having directly experienced these personally in his life. In his free time he likes running, playing the piano and writing music, learning Korean (where he lived for a year and a half before attending BYU), and seeing friends.
